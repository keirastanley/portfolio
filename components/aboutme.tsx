Before that, my work was centred around foreign languages and I spent most of my free time making music, painting and playing chess. Coming from a non-STEM background, I&#39d assumed I&#39d be poorly suited to coding but the skills I had honed from my hobbies and interests turned out to be invaluable when learning to code, from pattern recognition and attention to detail, to logical analysis and creative thinking.</p></div>
