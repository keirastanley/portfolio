            <p>Hi, I&#39;m Keira. 
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            As a junior full-stack developer, I have a solid understanding of  JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and Express, as well as a unique background and set of skills that sets me apart from others in the field.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            My greatest passion in life has always been music. I&#39;ve been playing the piano since I was a child and have been composing and producing music for many years. This passion has given me an appreciation for the similarities between creating structured patterns and sequences of information in music and coding. Both require attention to detail, logical thinking and problem-solving, whether it&#39;s figuring out how to handle a clash of sonic frequencies or how to fix a bug in a program.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I&#39;m also passionate about languages and translation, which I studied at university. After graduation, I moved to Spain, where I lived for 4 years working as a language instructor. Not only have I taken advantage of the similarities between translating English to Spanish and translating human language to code, but my ability to adapt my speech and break down complex information into simplified concepts has been invaluable when collaborating with other programmers, especially when explaining problems or difficult concepts.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Overall, I&#39;m a versatile and skilled developer who is able to draw on my diverse background to create innovative and effective solutions.</p>
